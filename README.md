eSeeCode
========

**Educational programming language and graphic platform** for all ages from 3-years-old to **K12**, adapting to each age and level of knowledge.

The platform is free and open source and is available online at [http://www.eseecode.com](http://www.eseecode.com).

The platform offers **4 different views** of the code, being able to program from a pure **graphical** click-and-run interface (called the Touch view) to a pure **text** synthax highlighting editor (called the Code view), with two middle interfaces (Drag and Build views). On top of that, the first three views **can be displayed as a diagram flow**. This allows for a **smooth progress in programming learning** while keeping a common general interface, platform and instruction set, avoiding the need to learn a new language every now and then during the learning process.

The language is based on JavaScript, specifically ECMAScript 5.1 (although this base is well hidden), so after mastering in Code view the user can program freely on a real programming language like JavaScript.
